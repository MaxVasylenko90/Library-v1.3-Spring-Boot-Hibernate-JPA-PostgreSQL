# Library-v1.3-Spring-Boot-Hibernate-JPA-PostgreSQL
This is the application for library service. It helps with CRUD operations, also has relationships between people and books in library. It can be used by Admin (which can do any operations) and by User. The user has an access only for his personal page and can see only his information and what books he currently has. 
With help of Bootstrap and Thymeleaf template engine it has a nice user-friendly front-end interface. 
I did it using these technologies:
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring MVC
- Spring Security
- Hibernate
- PostgreSQL
- Bootstrap
- Thymeleaf
